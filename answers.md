1. Challenge 1:
  - Answer: A
  - Explanation: it will print xyz twice because the the foo variable was changed inside the function, and the function already has a console.log inside, so calling the function and console.log foo after the function, will print twice xyz.


2. Challenge 2:
  - Answer: C
  - Explanation: it will print 10 and 1 because the the foo variable was declared to 1 before the function, and once the function is called with a specific argument, that argument has the value changed only inside the function. So when the function is called with the same argument, prints the value given inside the function, and the console.log prints the original value of the variable.
  

3. Challenge 3:
