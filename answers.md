1. Challenge 1:
  - Answer: xyz and xyz.
  - Explanation: when we invoke the function, it changes the value of the variable let foo and it console log the first xyz as it is inside the scope of the function. When we console log again out of the function it gives back the changed value.


2. Challenge 2:
  - Answer:10 and 1
  - Explanation: first it console log the variable let a changed inside the function as let has a block scope and it is inside of it and then the second console log would console log the let a= 1 as the console log and the variable are both in the global scope.


3. Challenge 3:
  - Answer:"Hi There!"
  - Explanation: The function would be moved to the top because of the hoisting and run it normally.


4. Challenge 4:
  - Answer: 90
  - Explanation: because the a and b has the same reference address and the b.name is just changing the value of the object described in the variable a. It wouldnÂ´t matter to console log the a or b as the have the same reference address and share the value stored in it.
