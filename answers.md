1. Challenge 1:
  - Answer: B
  - Explanation: The variable gets reassigned to "xyz" in the function, then when the function gets called it prints to the console the console.log inside of the function, and then after the other console.log is executed with the reassigned value because of shadowing.


2. Challenge 2:
  - Answer: C (put "A" originally because I got confused with the shadowing thing)
  - Explanation: The variable 'a' gets assigned a new value in the function scope because it's passed as an argument, which will not change it globally.


3. Challenge 3:
  - Answer: C
  - Explanation: Function declarations are hoisted, which means the interpreter executes them first, therefore it doesn't matter which line they are declared on.


4. Challenge 4:
  - Answer: C
  - Explanation: Assigning the object of 'a' to 'b' will give them the same reference in the static memory, meaning that any changes made to 'b' (stored in the dynamic memory) will be made to 'a' too.


5. Bonus - Challenge 5:
  - Answer: C (I went for "A")
  - Explanation: I'm a bit confused
