1. Challenge 1:
  - Answer: b
  - Explanation: The output if the provided code will be as such because the value of the variable "foo" is changed by the function. Since both console-log()'s were done after the function changed the aforementioned variable's value from "abc" to "xyz", this last value will be the one who is printed. In this case, twice so.


2. Challenge 2:
  - Answer: c
  - Explanation: In this case, both console.log()'s will have different results because the first one will print the value of "a" after it was updated inside the function, which is 10. The second will print "1", as it is the value of the variable a outside the function action space.


3. Challenge 3:
  - Answer: c
  - Explanation: I got this one wrong at first, as I thought calling the function before it being read by the script would give rise to an error. As it happens, it has to do with hoisting, which means the calling of a function may be written and the function itself made ready for use regardless of their appearence order.


4. Challenge 4:
  - Answer: c
  - Explanation: This will be the answer because even though "a" and "b" are different variables, they both refer to the same object. By changing its value using "b", printing "a" will show a result that reflects that same change.

5. Bonus - Challenge 5:
  - Answer: 
  - Explanation: I have many questions regarding how this function is affecting the objects. I have looked for answers online but I will still leave this one blank.
